## Project Description:  
The Dream-11 React project is a fantasy sports app that lets users choose players from real life to build and manage their virtual teams. This React-built application shows available players, retrieves player information from a local JSON file, and lets users add or remove players from the team of their choice. A virtual "coin" system is also included, in which users can spend coins to choose players and get free coins to increase their balance. The app incorporates notifications using react-toastify to give feedback on user actions, such as adding players or handling insufficient coins, and uses React hooks to manage state and conditional rendering. For a responsive and seamless user experience, the user interface has multiple sections and a sticky navbar.
